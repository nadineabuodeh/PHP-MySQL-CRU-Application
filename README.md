# PHP MySQL CRU Application

This repository contains a PHP application designed to perform basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on a MySQL database using XAMPP. The application showcases how PHP can be integrated with a backend database, enabling users to interact with data through a graphical user interface. This project is ideal for those looking to understand the basics of web development with PHP and MySQL, as well as the integration of front-end technologies such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and jQuery.

## Features

- **Create:** Add new entries to the database.
- **Read:** View existing entries according to the primary key.
- **Update:** Modify existing entries.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:
- XAMPP (PHP 7.4+ and MySQL 5.7+ recommended)
- Any modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- Basic knowledge of PHP, MySQL, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

## Installation

1. **Download and Install XAMPP:**
   Start by downloading XAMPP from [Apache Friends](https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html) and follow the installation instructions for your operating system.

2. **Clone the Repository:**
   Clone this repository to your local machine inside the `htdocs` folder of your XAMPP installation directory.

3. **Start Apache and MySQL:**
Open the XAMPP Control Panel and start the Apache and MySQL modules. Ensure both services are running.

4. **Create a MySQL Database:**
Access phpMyAdmin by visiting `http://localhost/phpmyadmin` in your web browser. Create a new database for the application.

5. **Configure Database Connection:**
Open the PHP application files and modify the database connection settings with your database details (host, username, password, database name) in the relevant PHP file (usually `db.php` or `config.php`).

6. **Access the Application:**
Open a web browser and navigate to `http://localhost/your-repository-name` to start using the application.

## Usage

Once the application is installed and running, you can use the graphical user interface to perform CRU operations. The interface is intuitive, providing forms and buttons to add, view, edit, and delete records from the MySQL database.
